# Lecture notes - week 1, Thursday
_Aug 30, 2018_

## Prefatory Remarks
### Green card / red card voting
Yes/no. In other contexts, faster/slower
- laptops today?
- laptops possible whole semester?
- alternate times?

## Syllabus
(visit webcampus page)

### Course style
Hands on, learning-by-doing
Modeled on the methods of intensive workshops
7 of the next 8 sessions will be based on Data Carpentry genomics workshops. (datacarpentry.org) Why?
1. Attendees generally rate "XXXX Carpentry" workshops highly
2. Their statement of the problem and aims align with mine (use real material to do real work; no shying away from the challenges of the command-line and programming)
3. They also argue against speeding through the crucial Unix steps.
4. A second source for the material least likely to be familiar to laboratory scientists may be invaluable. Allows revisiting material by you on-demand.

### Schedule

(back to syllabus page)

### Participation:
Learning-by-doing means participation is essential
Defined as:
 - attempting the activities in class (most important)
 - asking for help, questions, challenging instructor
 - testing solutions
 - telling me to slow down / speed up
 - we'll use a service called gitter.im to chat and share text live in class

### Projects:
2 Projects. Mid-term and final.
#### Mid-term project:
Mid-terms will be individual, and focused on planning a project, setup work, presenting the idea, and possibly initial work.
- Because we will devote a lot of time to getting used to computing, I wil not expect the mid-term project to be a completed execution of an idea, wrapped up with working code, results and excellent figures.
- The focus here will be on a proposal and plan of work and a pitch to the class for what you wish to pursue.
- After the pitches, students may elect to form small groups for their final projects, with permission. I see this as a way for those with similar aims to join forces.
- Should I allow people to abandon unrelated projects if they really like someone else's pitch a lot?
#### Final project:
Final may be individual or small group, with permission, and to apply the course methods to a problem, question, and dataset.
- Code will be submitted
- Methods will be written
- Results and findings presented
- If things didn't work, I want to know that too / in lieu of strong results.

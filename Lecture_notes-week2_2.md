## Roadmap
### Previously:

- Assignment 1 (data gathering)
- Data Carpentry Genomics Organization Session
	- Data tidyness
	- Metadata / data relationship

### Today
- Using the NCBI SRA (to view SRA metadata, conclusion of Genomics Organization materials)
- Data Carpentry Genomics Command Line
- Logging in to our server for the very first time
- Assignment 2: Flipped classroom videos & responses

### Genomics Organization Section 3
[Examining Data on the NCBI SRA Database](https://datacarpentry.org/organization-genomics/03-ncbi-sra/index.html)

Notes: How big is SRA now? [This big](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/docs/sragrowth/)

## Data Carpentry's Introduction to the Command Line
[Data Carpentry Shell Genomics](https://datacarpentry.org/shell-genomics/)

### Introducing the Shell
(https://datacarpentry.org/shell-genomics/01-introduction/index.html)

#### Logging in to our remote server

We will `ssh` into a server named `ws-3-0-5.biochem.unr.edu` (or `134.197.51.225` if the DNS is still flaky today.)

Use these instructions:
 (https://github.com/UNR-HPC/pronghorn/wiki/1.0-Connecting-to-Pronghorn), Note that we will be using the name of our server instead of the addresses shown in their instructions.

#### Mac OS and linux
Interface with the remote server will be done with an app named Terminal, already on your system

#### Windows
Use putty to get an ssh-like terminal login.

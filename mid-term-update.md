## Mid-term proposals

Now due Oct 30th. To be presented Oct 30th and Nov 1.

## Concept

Your task for the mid-terms is to create a short (5 min) presentation proposing your final project and a more detailed written description of the plan. Think of a methods section, written in the future tense. I will provide examples of both in class on Oct 16th.

### Written portion
I want to see a description of the work: what is the question being answered, hypothesis tested, the system being studied, the nature of the data, source of the data, and most importantly, a description of all the tools you will use to carry out the analysis. And I do mean all of the tools. If you were doing the small variant analysis from our lessons, I want to see you describe (origin of the data), plan to transfer it to our server, your use of FastQC, Trimmomatic (and with what settings), another FastQC of the trimmed data, the BWA aligner, samtools, bcftools, and visualization methods. For data transformations and plots in R, I wish to see you name the particular packages you'll use (e.g. DESeq2, not just "Bioconductor").

It will help if you find an existing paper or papers that you seek to implement the methods thereof (possibly in a different organism or set of conditions, but following the same toolchain). If you like their figures, how will you create your versions of them? How will you get the data to the point where it can be visualized?

### Presentation portion

Because of time constraints, your presentations will have to omit some or much of this detail, and for that, I want the overview of the system, data source, hypothesis and the major points of your intended analysis. A slide or image showing examples of the figures you want to construct will probably help you illustrate. The presentations can probably only be 3 to 7 slides long, so it may help to conceive of your talk as a "pitch" and keep it relatively high-level.

If you have open questions in your methods you'll use, you can say so (in the pitch and in the written version), but you will need to quickly fill in those gaps in order to execute this work to completion in time for the final.

# BCH 709 Lecture notes: Week 2, part 1
_Tuesday, September 4, 2018_
## Roadmap
- Previously: Assignment 1
- Today: Data Carpentry Genomics Organization Session
- Next: Data Carpentry Genomics Command Line

## Assignment 1
[WebCampus link for Assignment 1](https://unr.canvaslms.com/courses/32584/assignments/297535)
Spotlight on Question 2
- I asked you to create a new repo for the course at Github
- Then asked you to paste a mostly readable paragraph of text into a new file within
- Did you notice anything interesting?
- Will someone paste their URL in the Gitter channel?

### Markdown & Github flavored Markdown
[Markdown cheatsheet](https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/)
[Invented by John "Daring Fireball" Gruber](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)
- you will find the *backtick* kind of quotation marks extremely useful in future lectures, as it is how we will share solutions to questions in class. `It preserves the exact text within it.`
- and Gitter knows how to parse backticks along with the rest of Markdown syntax

## Today: Data Carpentry's Genomics Workshop - Genomics Organization
The main conceit of today's lesson is considering how to organize your data in preparation for a Next-generation Sequencing Experiment

We will need one more thing not covered in Assignment 1. Some kind of spreadsheet software (Excel, LibreOffice Calc, Numbers)
There will be prompts for discussion, and for each of these, you'll discuss with your neighbor, and jot some thoughts in the gitter channel

Notes: On data storage
A storage solution available here at UNR
- Pronghorn HPC system
- $8/TB-month (https://www.unr.edu/research-computing/hpc/fees)

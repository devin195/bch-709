# Assignment 1: Setting up services.
_This assignment uses WebCampus. Follow the instructions and submit answers to the questions using the WebCampus interface. If the WebCampus interface is confusing or non-operable, email your answers to instructor directly._

## Question 1
Sign up for an account at github. Choose any username you wish and use your unr.edu email if you have one. If you already have an account at github, you may re-use it or create a new one just for this class -- it's up to you. Tell me the username you chose as your answer to Question 1.

## Question 2
Create a New Repository using the github web interface (look for a green button labelled "New" or "Create New Repository." Name your repository BCH_709 or similar. Optionally add a description. Leave it public. Initialize it with a README.md. Hit the create button. Now edit the readme by clicking the pencil icon. Write one or more sentences of content into this readme.

**Warning: the following instructions require copy/paste from the WebCampus version of this document**


Create a new file using the white button labelled `Create new file`. Name this file `Assignment_1.md`. Paste this paragraph from WebCampus (yes this paragraph) into the file in the **Edit new file** box. Click the _Preview_ tab and check out how it looks. Now scroll down a little to the `Commit new file` section of the page. It has two text boxes. You can leave the 1-line box as-is or write a short description of your choosing. In the larger box which says `Add an optional description`, describe what you saw/see when you hit **_Preview._** Click the green button to commit.

Github sends you back to the base of the repository after you commit files like you just did. Click on the Assignment_1.md file name. Finally, go to your browser's URL bar, select, copy, and paste the whole URL for Assignment_1.md as your answer to Question 2.

## Question 3
Create a gitter account. Link it to your github account. Visit my github account `https://github.com/rltillett`. Find my repository for this class. Click the *chat on gitter* badge and say hello in the chat room. We'll be using this service throughout the course to share text, links, code and questions live during class sessions and after-hours too. Please observe UNR policies against harrasment, but otherwise, this chat is for you and you're free to use it however you, we and I want for the next few months. But for now, say something in the chat and make sure it works. Confirm that you've done this as your answer to Question 3.

## Question 4
Tell me your UNR netid. I'll be using it to create your login for the server we'll be using this semester. Just the netid. No passwords please. Ever.

## Question 5
Install a code-friendly text editor on your laptop, work machine, lab computer, home computer, etc. I suggest Atom, Microsoft VS Code, or BBedit (Mac only). For Chromebooks, you might want to try Text (by text.app) or Caret. Answer Question 5 with which editor you installed, which OS or OSes, and whether you were successful or not.

## Question 6
Install RStudio on your laptop (and optionally additional machines). Report success/failure, OS, R and RStudio version numbers.
